# clone_rasp_disk
Tool for cloning Raspberry Pi disk or SD card to another driver (even for smaller space). You can use it in your Raspberry, rather than using another Linux device. And it is very simple!

## Usage
The usage is simple:

```
./clone_rasp_disk.sh [target_device_name]
```

For example:

```
./clone_rasp_disk.sh /dev/sdb
```

It will clone your local Raspberry Pi system and files to target disk `/dev/sdb`.
